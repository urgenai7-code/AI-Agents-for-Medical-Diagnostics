### Final Diagnosis:

- **Panic Disorder/Anxiety-Related Hyperventilation:**
  - Reason: The patient's symptoms, including intense chest pain, palpitations, shortness of breath, dizziness, and a feeling of impending doom, are characteristic of panic attacks. Both the cardiologist and psychologist reports suggest panic disorder as a likely cause, especially given the patient's history of anxiety and the absence of significant cardiac issues.

- **GERD-Related Symptoms:**
  - Reason: GERD is mentioned in both the cardiologist and pulmonologist reports as a potential contributor to the patient's symptoms. GERD can mimic cardiac symptoms and cause respiratory issues like shortness of breath and chest pain, which may exacerbate anxiety and panic symptoms.

- **Premature Ventricular Contractions (PVCs):**
  - Reason: Although considered benign, the cardiologist report notes occasional PVCs, which can contribute to the sensation of palpitations and may be more noticeable during periods of anxiety or stress. This could be a contributing factor to the patient's overall symptomatology.
